This cooperative approach to education was\nfacilitated through the use of GitHub, a platform that encourages\ncollaborative coding and content development.\n\n\nStudents contributed to the lecture notes by submitting pull requests\nto our dedicated GitHub repository. This method not only enriched the\ncourse material but also provided students with practical experience\nin collaborative software development and version control. To view\nthese contributions and the lecture notes in their entirety, please\nvisit our Spring 2024 repository at <https://github.com/statds/ids-s24>.\n\n\nFor those interested in exploring the lecture notes from the previous\nyears, the [Spring 2023](https://github.com/statds/ids-s23) and\n[Spring 2024](https://github.com/statds/ids-s22)\nare both publicly accessible. These archives offer\nvaluable insights into the evolution of the course content and the\ndifferent perspectives brought by successive student cohorts.\n\n## Midterm Project\n\nOur mid-term project on rat sightings in New York City is to be\nshowcased in a virtual session at the NYC Open Data Week, 2024, the\nweek following the Spring Break. Four students will be selected to\npresent topics on the mid-term project.\n\n## Final Project\n\nStudents are encouraged to start designing their final projects from\nthe beginning of the semester. There are many open data that can be\nused. Here is a list of data challenges that you may find useful:\n\n+ [ASA Data Challenge Expo](https://community.amstat.org/dataexpo/home)\n+ [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)\n+ [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org)\n+ [Top 10 Data Science Competitions in\n  2024](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/data-science/data-science-competitions)\n\nIf you work on sports analytics, you are welcome to submit a\nposter to [UConn Sports Analytics Symposium\n(UCSAS) 2024](https://statds.org/events/ucsas2024/).\n\n\n## Adapting to Rapid Skill Acquisition\n\nIn this course, students are expected to rapidly acquire new skills, a\ncritical aspect of data science. To emphasize this, consider this\ninsightful quote from @vanderplas2016python:\n\n> When a technologically-minded person is asked to help a friend, family member,\n> or colleague with a computer problem, most of the time it's less a matter of\n> knowing the answer as much as knowing how to quickly find an unknown\n> answer. In data science it's the same: searchable web resources such as online\n> documentation, mailing-list threads, and StackOverflow answers contain a\n> wealth of information, even (especially?) if it is a topic you've found\n> yourself searching before. Being an effective practitioner of data science is\n> less about memorizing the tool or command you should use for every possible\n> situation, and more about learning to effectively find the information you\n> don't know, whether through a web search engine or another means.\n\nThis quote captures the essence of what we aim to develop in our\nstudents: the ability to swiftly navigate and utilize the vast\nresources available to solve complex problems in data science.\n\n## Wishlist\n\nThis is a wish list from all members of the class (alphabetical\norder, last name first, comma, then first name).\nAdd yours through a pull request; note the syntax of nested list in\nMarkdown.\n\n\n+ Chugh, Charitarth\n    - Get better at analyzing data/features\n    - Learn about more xgboost & gradient boosted trees. \n+ Lee, Joshua\n    - Improve model optimization techniques\n    - learn how to conduct better feature engineering\n    - learn how to perform better model selection and feature selection\n    - learn how to deploy ml models and processes to the cloud\n+ Massad, Olivia\n    - Be able to use Git effectively\n    - Gain knowledge about Data Science and its importance\n+ Nguyen, Leon\n    - Become proficient in utilizing Git and GitHub workflow processes\n    - Develop proficiency in Quarto and Python packages\n    - Create a data science project start to finish for portfolio work\n+ Patel, Pratham\n    - Become more proficient and efficient with GitHub and Python\n    - Get a deeper understanding and appreciate of the Data Science workflow\n    - Understand collaboration and project creation on GitHub\n+ Perez, Isabelle \n    - Become comfortable working with git and quarto \n    - Learn data management strategies and the relevant \n    programming skills \n+ Pugh, Alex\n    - Increase my knowledge of Git and Python\n    - Learn to efficiently clean a data set\n+ Qualls, William\n    - Better understand the Data Science Pipeline\n    - Gain practical knowledge with tools such as Github that aren't covered in other classes\n+ Schober, Henry\n    - Be more proficient in Git and Python\n    - Deepen my understanding of Data Science\n+ Taki, William\n    - Get comfortable with Git and Python\n    - Use the learnings from this class to help with STAT 33494W\n+ Xie, Vincent\n    - Become more proficient with Git.\n    - Learn how to create a proper data science project.\n    - Be introduced to core concepts in data science.\n+ Yan, Jun\n    - Make data science more accessible to undergraduates\n    - Co-develop a Quarto book in collaboration with the students\n    - Train students to participate real data science competitions\n+ Yankson, Emmanuel\n    - Get better with python\n    - Get an A in STAT 3255\n\n\n## Presentation Orders\n\nThe topic presentation order is set up in class.\n\n::: {#69b3d635 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nwith open('rosters/3255.txt', 'r') as file:\n    ug = [line.strip() for line in file]\nwith open('rosters/5255.txt', 'r') as file:\n    gr = [line.strip() for line in file]\npresenters = ug + gr\n\nimport random\nrandom.seed(4737 + 8852 + 3196 + 2344 + 47) # jointly set by the class on 01/24/2024\nrandom.sample(presenters, len(presenters))\n## random.shuffle(presenters) # This would shuffle the list in place\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=1}\n```\n['Elliott,Matt A',\n 'Wu,Weijia',\n 'Lek,Victor Khun',\n 'Taki,William Hiroyasu',\n 'Schober,Henry',\n 'Lee,Joshua Jian',\n 'Patel,Pratham Subhas',\n 'Li,Ge',\n 'Zhang,Xingye',\n 'Dennison,Jack Thomas',\n 'Massad,Olivia Grace',\n 'Perez,Isabelle Daenerys Halpine',\n 'Yankson,Emmanuel Opoku',\n 'Li,David',\n 'Mori,Abigail Kanoelani Shim',\n 'Nguyen,Leon Duc',\n 'Pugh,Alex',\n 'Chugh,Charitarth',\n 'Xie,Vincent',\n 'Vijayaraghavendra,Jyothsna',\n 'Qualls,William Wayne',\n 'Woo,Madison Nicole',\n 'Hook,Braedon',\n 'Chowaniec,Amelia Elizabeth']\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSwitching slots is allowed as long as you find someone who\nis willing to switch with you.

Remember that these class notes are publicly\navailable online with your names attached.  Here are some resources on []how to\navoid plagiarism](https://usingsources.fas.harvard.edu/how-avoid-plagiarism). \nIn particular, in our course, one convenient way to avoid plagiarism is to use\nour own data (e.g., NYC Open Data). Combined with your own explanation of the\ncode chunks, it would be hard to plagiarize.\n\n\n### Homework Requirements\n\n+ Use the repo from Git Classroom to submit your work. See @sec-git.\n    - Keep the repo clean (no tracking generated files).\n\t- Never \"Upload\" your files; use the git command lines.\n\t- Make commit message informative (think about the readers).\n+ Use `quarto` source only. See @sec-quarto.\n+ For the conveinence of greading, add your html output to a release in your\n  repo.\n\n\n## Practical Tips\n\n### Data analysis\n\n+ Use an IDE so you can play with the data interactively\n+ Collect codes that have tested out into a script for batch processing\n+ During data cleaning, keep in mind how each variable will be used later\n+ No keeping large data files in a repo; assume a reasonable location with your collaborators\n\n### Presentation\n\n+ Don't forget to introduce yourself if there is no moderator\n+ Highlight your research questions and results, not code\n+ Give an outline, carry it out, and summarize\n\n\n<!-- Topic presentation template -->\n## My Presentation Topic (Template)\n\n\n### Introduction\n\nPut an overview here. Use Markdown syntax.\n\n\n### Sub Topic 1\n\nPut materials on topic 1 here\n\nPython examples can be put into `python` code chunks:\n\n::: {#17ee28cb .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# do something\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Sub Topic 2\n\nPut materials on topic 2 here.\n\n### Sub Topic 3\n\nPut matreials on topic 3 here.\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nPut sumaries here.\n\n",
