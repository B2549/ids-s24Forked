## Statistical Modeling with `statsmodels`

This section was written by Leon Nguyen.

### Introduction

Hello! My name is Leon Nguyen (they/she) and I am a second-year undergraduate 
student studying Statistical Data Science and Mathematics at the University 
of Connecticut, aiming to graduate in Fall 2025. One of my long-term goals is to 
make the field of data science more accessible to marginalized communities and 
minority demographics. My research interests include statistical modeling, 
data visualization, and design. Statistical modeling is one of the most 
fundamental skills required for data science, and it's important to have a solid 
understanding of how models work to communicate effectively with collaborators. 


### What is `statsmodels`?

The `statsmodels` Python package offers a diverse range of classes and functions 
tailored for estimating various statistical models, conducting statistical tests, 
and exploring statistical data. Each estimator provides an extensive array of 
result statistics, rigorously tested against established statistical packages to 
ensure accuracy. 

Python examples can be put into `python` code chunks:

```{python}
import pandas as pd

# do something
```
