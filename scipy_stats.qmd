# Introduction 

# Basic Statistical Hypothesis Tests 
## Two-sample t-test 
* Assumes observations are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d), 
normally distributed, and have equal variances. 
* Takes parameter alternative that can be set to "two_sided", "less", or "greater". 
* Takes optional parameter for handling null values. 
  + Can "propagate" (return NaN), "raise" (raise `ValueError`), or "omit"(ignore null values). 
* Takes optional boolean parameter indicating equal variances. 
  + Default is True.  
  + If set to False, performs Welch's t-test, which doesn't use pooled sample variance. 

| H~0~: $\mu_1 = \mu_2$, where $\mu_i$ is the population mean of population $i$  
| H~1~: $\mu_1 \neq$ or $>$ or $<$ $\mu_2$ 

## Paired t-test 
* Same assumptions as t-test with addition of observations across the two samples being 
paired. 
* Same null and alternate hypotheses as t-test and same parameters.  
* The input arrays must have the same shape. 

| H~0~: $\mu_1 = \mu_2$
| H~1~: $\mu_1 \neq$ or $>$ or $<$ $\mu_2$   

# Normality 
## Shapiro-Wilk Test 
* Used to test normality of a data sample.
* Assumes observations are i.i.d. 

| H~0~: data is drawn from a normal distribution  
| H~1~: data is not drawn from a normal distribution    

## NormalTest 
* Based on the D'Agostino-Pearson test for assessing normality with shape. 
  + Measures skewness and kurtosis, which is the heaviness/lightness of the tail. 
  + A normal distribution has skewness of $0$ and kurtosis of $3$.  
* Assumes observations are i.i.d. 

| H~0~: data is drawn from a normal distribution  
| H~1~: data is not drawn from a normal distribution   

# Correlation   
## Pearson's Correlation 
* Tests for a linear relationship between two samples.
* Assumes observations are i.i.d, normally distributed, and have equal variances.  
* Returns a correlation coefficient as well as the test statistic and p-value. 
* Raises `ConstantInputWarning` if an input array has all constant values.   

| H~0~: the samples are independent 
| H~1~: there exists dependency between the samples 

# Nonparametric Hypothesis Tests   
## Mann-Whiney U Test 
* Tests that two samples are drawn from the same distribution. 
* Assumes observations are i.i.d. and can be ranked/compared. 
* Nonparametric version of t-test.  

H0: distribution of sample 1 = distribution of sample 2
H1: distribution of sample 1 !=/>/< distribution of sample 2  

## Kruskal-Wallis H Test 
* Tests that two or more samples are drawn from the same distribution. 

H0: all the samples have the same distribution 
H1: at least two samples have differing distributions
